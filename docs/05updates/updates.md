![Copy of workshop.png](Updates%20dafbbf465a8c46ffb141214d62377520/Copy_of_workshop.png)

Due to new covid restrictions we had to move our second part of the workshop online, but this did not keep us from sharing new information and having others learn more about cloud computing!

In Collaboration with the high performance computing center at the TU Delft we organized a workshop on the topic of cluster computing. Together with their expert (Dennis Palagin) we made it possible to visualize a cluster computer with a raspberry pi and multiple raspberry pi zero's.
